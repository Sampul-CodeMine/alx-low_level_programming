# LOW LEVEL PROGRAMMING

## C Programming Language

In this phase of our ALX journey, we will be looking at programming using C programming language.

## Low-Level Programming Language

A low-level programming language is a programming language that provides little or no abstraction from a computer's instruction set architecture; commands or functions in the language are structurally similar to a processor's instructions. Generally, this refers to either machine code or assembly language. Because of the low (hence the word) abstraction between the language and machine language, low-level languages are sometimes described as being "close to the hardware". Programs written in low-level languages tend to be relatively non-portable, due to being optimized for a certain type of system architecture

**_C Programming Language_** is regarded as a low level programming language. This is because C programming language creates system applications that can directly interact with hardware devices such as kernels, drivers, etc. It was originally developed for writing **Operating Systems**.

# DATA STRUCTURE

A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data. There are several basic and advanced types of data structures, all designed to arrange data to suit a specific purpose. It is a way of structuring data in order to efficiently create, store/save, find/retrieve, use/modify the data depending on the task you need it for. 

## Types of Datatypes In a Data Structure:

- Built-in datatypes:
  - Integers (long, short, int)
  - Boolean (true,false)
  - Floats (float, double, decimal)
  - Characters
  - Strings
- Derived datatypes
  - List
  - Array
  - Stack
  - Queue

## Operations Performed on a Data Structure:

- Traversing: printing or going through a data structure's elements one by one.
- Searching: Search for an element using a given index from the data structure.
- Inserting: Adding a new element to the given data structure.
- Deleting: Removing an element from a given data structure using a specified index.
- Sorting: Arranging the elements in a data structure in either ascnding or descending order using a criteria
- Merging: joining two or more data structures having the same data types.
- Updating: replacing the value of a data structure's element with another value using ga specified index or criteria.

## Classification of Data Structure

Data structure is classified into 2: Linear Data Structure and Non-linear Data Structure.

### Linear Data Structure

**Linear Data Structure:** In this data structure, elements are arranged sequentially or linearly where each element is attached to its previous or next adjacent element.

This type of data structure is diveided into 2:

- Static Linear Data Structure: Here the data structure has a fixed memory and access to the elements is easier.
  - Arrays

- Dynamic Linear Data Structure: the size of the data structure is not fixed. It can be randomly updated during runtime
  - Queue
  - Stack
  - Linked List

### Non-Linear Data Structure

**Non-Linear Data Structure:** In this data structure, elements are not arranged sequentially or linearly.

This type of data structure we have:

- Trees
- Graphs

## NODES

**A NODE** is a collection of two sub-elements where one part stores the value of the element and the other part stores/links to the next node.

## LINKED LISTS

**Linked Lists** are a type of linear Data structure where elements are linked using pointers. It consist of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference or pointer to the next node in the list.

We have 4 types of Linked-List:

- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Circular Linked-List
- Circular Doubly Linked-List

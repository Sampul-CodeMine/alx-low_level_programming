# MORE FUNCTIONS
----------------
## Recursion and Recursive Functions
-------------------------

In this phase of our Low level language programming, we will be dealing with "What is recursion" and we will write some recursive functions.
- [x] What is recursion?
- [x] How to implement recursion
- [x] In what situations you should and should not implement recursion

A recursive function is simply a function that calls itself.

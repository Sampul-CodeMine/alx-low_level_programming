# MORE FUNCTIONS
----------------
## More Functions and Nested Loops
-------------------------

In this phase of our Low level language programming, we will be dealing with arrays, pointers, strings.
- Pointers are variables or names given to memoryset that holds the address information of a variable
- Arrays are derived datatypes or data structures used to store fixed number of like datatyped variables.
- Strings are also derived dstatype which is a array of char datatypes.

Many more will be discussed in this phase.

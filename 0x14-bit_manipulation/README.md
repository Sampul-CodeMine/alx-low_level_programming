# BIT MANIPULATION IN C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE

Bit manipulation is the act of algorithmically manipulating bits or other pieces of data shorter than a word (8-bits or 1 byte). 

Computer programming tasks that requires bit manipulation includes low-level device control, error detection, and correction algorithms, data compression, encryption algorithms, and optimization.

A big advantage of bit manipulation is that it can help to iterate over all the subsets of an N-element set. As we all know there are 2N possible subsets of any given set with N elements.

Source codes that manipulates bits make use of the `bitwise` operators. The `bitwise` operators are listed below:

- `AND` denoted with the unary operator `&`
- `OR` denoted with the unary operator `|`
- `XOR` denoted with the unary operator `^`
- `Complement` denoted with the unary operator `~` often referred to as the `negation` or `NOT` keyword.
- `Shift Left` denoted with the symbol `<<`
- `Shift Right` denoted with the symbol `>>`

Bit manipulation, in some cases can drastically reduce the need to loop through a data structure and can speed up execution as bit manipulation are processed in parallel.

# Pointers, arrays and strings

## Learning Objectives

* What are pointers and how to use them
* What are arrays and how to use them
* What are the differences between pointers and arrays
* How to use strings and how to manipulate them
* Scope of variables

In these phase of Low Level Programming using C Programming language, we will be dealing with Data Structures - in which our first derived datatype will be arrays.
In the like, we will be touching on pointers and how to use them.

Remember, Strings are arrays, so will be dealing with how to manipulate strings and also perform some functions on strings and arrays using pointers and dereferencing.

In this next phase of dealing with pointers, arrays and strings in C programming language, we will be writing several functions that manipulates strings (functions that uses arrays and pointers to manipulate strings).
